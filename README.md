# Patrika - Blockchain based News Sharing Website
(winner of HackTU Hackathon - [Devfolio Link](https://devfolio.co/projects/patrika-2f4e) )

**Description**

Patrika is a news sharing DApp application that runs on a decentralized network (blockchain) and allows users to share and access news in a decentralized way. Patrika has the potential to revolutionize the way we access and share news, by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for news sharing. The key benefits of Patrika:

1. Decentralization: Since the DApp runs on a decentralized network, it is not controlled by any single entity or organization. This means that users can access and share news without the need for a central authority or intermediaries.

2. Security: Blockchain technology is known for its high level of security, which means that a blockchain-based news sharing DApp is less vulnerable to hacking and other security threats.

3. Transparency: The decentralized nature of a blockchain-based news sharing DApp means that all transactions and interactions on the platform are recorded in a transparent manner, which can help to increase trust and accountability among users.

4. Censorship resistance: A blockchain-based news sharing DApp is resistant to censorship, as it is not controlled by any central authority. This means that users can access and share news freely, without the risk of censorship.
